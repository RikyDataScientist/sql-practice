# 🗄️ SQL Daily Practice

This repository documents my **daily SQL practice** using challenges from **Codewars** and **HackerRank (SQL tracks)**.
The goal is to build a strong foundation in **SQL and MySQL**, focusing on **DDL (Data Definition Language)**, while developing **efficient, clean, and coherent queries**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master **core SQL concepts** with MySQL syntax
- Write precise and optimized **DML queries** (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Improve **logical thinking and query efficiency**
- Progress towards solving **advanced SQL problems** with clarity and correctness
